# Image Warping Test

Based on this [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12017790/warp-image-to-appear-in-cylindrical-projection),
the application currently applies a cylindrical mapping to an image and displays both the source image and the warped result in separate windows.

The goal is to add a hemispherical mapping function to an image (convex or concave).
